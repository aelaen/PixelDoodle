This is a list of features that I will eventually implement into PixelDoodle:
JAVASCRIPT
>Sliders for picking size (Scale of 1 - 500?) Still trying to decide what the upmost limit should be
>Persistent memory (allow a user to set a size and those numbers to be preserved on submit)
>Dynamic grid (Allow grid to materialize on size value change)
>Preset values (allow options for preset grid dimensions.)
>Downloading images (allow user to save files for offline use)

CSS
>Clean up UI (Make it more pretty/beautiful)
>Allow different UI options (beautiful/console/bizarre?)
>Allow user to change UI to fit their preference

 More to come!
